# Google Colab tutorials

Use the runnable demo to learn the sequence, then complete the general authoring notebook.

**First-author task:** Run 00_runnable_demo.ipynb first. Scientific_Data_Colab_Tutorial_Template.ipynb supplies the eight-part author instructions and intentionally stops until project configuration is completed. Record tested runtime, scope, expected outputs and failure recovery.

**Start with:** [00_runnable_demo.ipynb](00_runnable_demo.ipynb).

## Instructor's uploaded tutorial sample

[Scientific_Data_Colab_Tutorial_Sample.ipynb](Scientific_Data_Colab_Tutorial_Sample.ipynb)
is the instructor's supplied notebook, preserved without edits to its cells or metadata.
It contains 49 cells, including 18 code cells, and follows the eight-part workflow from
source documentation through technical validation and independent reproduction.

The instructor also shared [this Google Drive Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13CYILher0diP4UBsZRgMTbaWIiyK7u6w?usp=sharing).
The file stored here is a copy of the supplied attachment; later edits in Google Drive
will need to be copied into GitHub separately.

Save your own copy, complete the AUTHOR INPUT prompts, set the actual project repository
and data versions, then test from a fresh runtime. This is an unexecuted authoring sample:
its configuration check intentionally stops until required project inputs are supplied.
The extended [authoring template](Scientific_Data_Colab_Tutorial_Template.ipynb) and
[runnable synthetic demo](00_runnable_demo.ipynb) remain available for reference.


## Author inputs for the completed project

| Item | Fill with verified information |
|---|---|
| Scientific purpose and observation unit | AUTHOR INPUT |
| Exact inputs, versions and source/DOI URLs | AUTHOR INPUT |
| Permanent GitHub code or folder links | AUTHOR INPUT |
| Commands, parameters and manual prerequisites | AUTHOR INPUT |
| Expected output paths, counts and units | AUTHOR INPUT |
| Access, rights, limitations and untested dimensions | AUTHOR INPUT |
| Independent check and evidence location | AUTHOR INPUT |

**Done when:** A separate reader reproduces the permitted example from a fresh runtime.

**Requirement mapping:** [Usage Notes and code](https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines); [reproducibility](https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist). These links identify the governing requirements;
the task instructions are teaching recommendations. Check the actual submission year.

## Real Oracle Atlas case

[Oracle_Atlas_Colab_Example.ipynb](Oracle_Atlas_Colab_Example.ipynb) provides all eight
parts for the pinned real one-case workflow. Its setup isolates Python 3.12 using
uv, avoids the host ensurepip assumption, and records code/data identities.
See [the scope and metadata instructions](../examples/oracle_review/README.md).
The template and synthetic examples above are separate learning resources.
